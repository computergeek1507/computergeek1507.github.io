### About
Animated Christmas Lighting popularity has grown in recent years. With the rise of Youtube and Social Media, People love to watch videos of Christmas Lights Dancing. Building an Animated Christmas Lights show is a very technical task and requires an understanding of electronics, networking, design, and modeling. To help users with this process, we are developing an application to automatically map physical Christmas light designs into the 3D software, xLights, to make the process easier. The software will automatically find the luminated lights location in a video file and map it location in space. These light locations can then be exported as a xModel file to be loaded in xLights. We plan to use the C# programing Language and the OpenCV library to develop the software.
