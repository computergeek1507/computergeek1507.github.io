#### About
Animated Christmas Lighting popularity has grown in recent year. With the rise of Youtube and Social Media, People love to watch videos of Christmas Lights Dancing. 
Building a Animated Christmas Lights show is a very technical task and requires a understaning of electronics, networking, design, and modeling. To help user with
this process, we are developing an application to automaticlly map physical christmas light designs into the 3D software, xLights, to make the process easier. The
software will automatically find the luminated lights location in a video file and maps it location in space. These light location can then be exported as a xModel
file to be loaded in xLights. We plan to use the C# programing Laugange and the OpenCV library to develop the software.
